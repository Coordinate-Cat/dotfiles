## 0.3.1 - 25 September 2018

### Fixed

* Error while generating Dockerfile for 'other' [#504](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/504)

## 0.3.0 - 21 September 2018

### Added

* Add Docker Files to Workspace
  - Support multiple versions of .NET Core (ASP .NET and Console apps)

### Fixed
* Some private registries returning 404 error [#471](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/471)
* You shouldn't have to reload vscode in order for changes to docker.attachShellCommand.{linux,windows}Container to take effect [#463](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/463)
* Engineering improvements (lint, tests, work toward strict null checking, etc.)

## 0.2.0 - 5 September 2018

### Added
* Add preview support for connecting to private registries
* Improved workflow for Tag Image:
  - User will be asked on the first usage of Tag Image with a registry to save it to the `docker.defaultRegistryPath` setting
  - User will be prompted to tag an image if attempting to push an image with no registry or username
  - New `Set as Default Registry Path` menu on registries
  - When default registry path is prefixed to the image name, it is selected for easy removal or editing
* Improved workflow for Build Image:
  - Previous image name will be remembered
* Azure container registries can now be browsed without having "Admin user" turned on. However, deploying to Azure app service currently still requires it, and you still need to log in to Azure in docker [#359](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/359)
* A new [API](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/blob/master/docs\api.md) has been added for other extensions to be able to control the "Add Docker Files to Workspace" functionality.
* You can now create and delete Azure (ACR) registries and delete Azure repositories and images directly from the extension.

### Fixed
* Images list does not refresh after tagging an image [#371](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/371)
* Don't prompt for Dockerfile if only one in project (command palette->Build Image) [#377](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/377)
* Docker Hub repos are not alphabetized consistently [#410](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/410)

* Error when listing Azure Registries when some of the accounts do not have appropriate permissions (thanks @estebanreyl) [#336](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/336)
* UDP exposed ports not launching correctly [#284](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/284)
* Adopt version 0.0.19 of the language server (thanks @rcjsuen) [#392](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/392). This fix includes:
  - Folding support for comments
  - Fix for [#338 Multi-line LABEL directives highlight as errors](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/338)
  - Support for handling SCTP ports in EXPOSE instructions per Docker CE 18.03
  - Optional warning/error for WORKDIR instructions that are not absolute paths (to try to enforce good practices per the official guidelines and recommendations document for Dockerfiles
  - New `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionWorkdirRelative` configuration setting
* Output title corrected [#428](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/428)

### Changed
* The `docker.defaultRegistry` setting is now obsolete. Instead of using a combination of `docker.defaultRegistry` and `docker.defaultRegistryPath`, now simply use `docker.defaultRegistryPath`. This will be suggested automatically the first time the extension is run.

  * `start Azure CLI` container
  * `stop container`
  * `system prune`
  * `tag` (we don't track tag name)
  * Configure workspace along with the type (e.g. Node or Other)

> Please note, you can turn off telemetry reporting for VS Code and all extensions through the ["telemetry.enableTelemetry": false setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
