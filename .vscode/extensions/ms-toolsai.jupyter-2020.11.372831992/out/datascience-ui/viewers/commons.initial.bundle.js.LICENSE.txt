 * NOTES:
 *     Cell/row DOM manipulations are done directly bypassing jQuery's DOM manipulation methods.
 *     This increases the speed dramatically, but can only be done safely because there are no event handlers
 *     or data associated with any cell/row DOM nodes.  Cell editors must make sure they implement .destroy()
 *     and do proper cleanup.
