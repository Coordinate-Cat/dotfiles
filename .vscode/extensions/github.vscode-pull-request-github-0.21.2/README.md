# Getting Started
It's easy to get started with GitHub Pull Requests for Visual Studio Code. Simply follow these steps to get started.

1. Make sure you have VSCode version 1.27.0 or higher.
1. Download the extension from [the marketplace](https://aka.ms/vscodepr-download).
1. Reload VS Code after the installation (click the reload button next to the extension).
1. Open your desired GitHub repository.
1. If you're using version 0.5.0 of the extension or higher, a new viewlet should be added to the bottom of the activity bar. For older versions, the `GitHub Pull Requests` treeview will appear in the SCM Viewlet.
1. You may need to configure the `githubPullRequests.remotes` setting, by default the extension will look for PRs for `origin` and `upstream`. If you have different remotes, add them to the remotes list.
1. A notification should appear asking you to sign in to GitHub; follow the directions to authenticate.
1. You should be good to go!

# Configuring the extension
There are several settings that can be used to configure the extension.

As mentioned above, `githubPullRequests.remotes` is used to specify what remotes the extension should try to fetch pull requests from.

To customize the pull request tree, you can use the `githubPullRequests.queries` setting. This setting is a list of labels and search queries which populate the categories of the tree. By default, these queries are "Waiting For My Review", "Assigned To Me", and "Created By Me". An example of adding a "Mentioned Me" category is to change the setting to the following:

```
"githubPullRequests.queries": [
	{
		"label": "Waiting For My Review",
		"query": "is:open review-requested:${user}"
	},
	{
		"label": "Assigned To Me",
		"query": "is:open assignee:${user}"
	},
	{
		"label": "Created By Me",
		"query": "is:open author:${user}"
	},
	{
		"label": "Mentioned Me",
		"query": "is:open mentions:${user}"
	}
]
```

Similarly, there is a setting to configure your issues queries: `githubIssues.queries`.

Queries use [GitHub search syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/understanding-the-search-syntax).

To view additional settings for the extension, you can open VS Code settings and search for "github pull requests".
