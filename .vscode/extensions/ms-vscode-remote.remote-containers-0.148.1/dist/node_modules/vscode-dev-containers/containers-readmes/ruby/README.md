## Using this definition with an existing folder

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of Ruby the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "2.7" }
```

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/base.Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:2`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:2.7`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:2.6`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:2.5`

Version specific tags tied to [releases in this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/releases) are also available.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:0-2`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:0.132-2`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:0.132.0-2`

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `base.Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

### Installing Node.js

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with a Ruby back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```json
"args": {
    "VARIANT": "2",
    "INSTALL_NODE": "true",
    "NODE_VERSION": "10"
}
```

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Ruby definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/ruby/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/ruby` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project.
6. You should see "Hello, Remote Extension Host!" followed by "Hello, Local Extension Host!" in the Debug Console after the program executes.
7. From here, you can add breakpoints or edit the contents of the `test-project` folder to do further testing.
