## Dapr Notes

When the dev container is created, the definition automatically initializes Dapr on a separate Docker network (to isolate it from Dapr instances running locally or in another Dapr dev container). This is done via the `postCreateCommand` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and the `DAPR_NETWORK` environment variable in the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`. The `DAPR_REDIS_HOST` and `DAPR_PLACEMENT_HOST` environment variables ensure that Dapr `run` commands implicitly connect to the Dapr instance in that Docker network.

## Using this definition with an existing folder

While the definition itself works unmodified, there are some tips that can help you deal with some of the defaults .NET Core uses.

### Using `ports` with ASP.NET Core

By default, ASP.NET Core only listens to localhost. If you use the `ports` property in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, the port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwarded. Unfortunately, means that ASP.NET Core only listens to localhost is inside the container itself. It needs to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally.

This container solves that problem by setting the environment variable `ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Http__Url` to `http://*:5000` in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`. Using an environment variable to override this setting in the container only, which allows you to leave your actual application config as-is for use when running locally.

`.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
environment:
  ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Http__Url: http://*:5000
ports:
  - 5000
```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Debug Configuration

Only the integrated terminal is supported by the Remote - Containers extension. You may need to modify `launch.json` configurations to include the following value if an external console is used.

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

### Installing Node.js or the Azure CLI

Given how frequently ASP.NET applications use Node.js for front end code, this container also includes Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating these lines in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
arg:
  INSTALL_NODE: "true"
  ARG NODE_VERSION: "10"
```

If you would like to install the Azure CLI update this line in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
arg:
  INSTALL_AZURE_CLI: "true"
  INSTALL_NODE: "true"
  ARG NODE_VERSION: "10"
```

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Dapr with C# (.NET Core 3.1) definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/dapr-dotnetcore-3.1/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/dapr-dotnetcore-latest` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, if prompted to restore packages in a notification, click "Restore".
6. Start the application with Dapr:

    ```bash
    $ cd test-project
    $ dapr run --app-id test --app-port 5000 --dapr-http-port 3500 --components-path ./components dotnet run
    ```

7. In a separate terminal, invoke the application via Dapr:

    ```bash
    # Deposit funds to the account (creating the account if not exists)
    $ curl -d 42 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -w "\n" -X POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/test/method/accounts/123/deposit
    42
    # Withdraws funds from the account
    $ curl -d 10 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -w "\n" -X POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/test/method/accounts/123/withdraw
    32
    # Get the balance of the account
    $ curl -w "\n" http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/test/method/accounts/123
    32
    $
    ```
