## Using this definition with an existing folder

While technically optional, this definition includes the Ansible extension. You may need an Azure account for your operations. You can create a [free trial account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and find out more about using [Ansible with Azure here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ansible/ansible-overview).

There are a few options you can pick from  by updating the following line in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```Dockerfile
"arg": {
   "INSTALL_AZURE_CLI": "true",
   "INSTALL_DOCKER": "true",
   "INSTALL_NODE": "true"
}
`
If you plan to use the Azure Cloud Shell for all of your Ansible operations, you can set `"INSTALL_DOCKER": "false"`. Conversely, if you do not plan to use Cloud Shell, you can set `"INSTALL_DOCKER": "false"`. By default, both are installed so you can decide later.

Beyond `git`, this `Dockerfile` includes `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development.

### Adding the definition to your project

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Azure Ansible definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/azure-ansible/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.
