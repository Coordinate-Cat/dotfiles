## Using this definition with an existing folder

This definition creates two containers, one for Python and one for PostgreSQL. VS Code will attach to the Python container, and from within that container the PostgreSQL container will be available on **`localhost`** port 5432. The default database is named `postgres` with a user of `postgres` whose password is `postgres`, and if desired this may be changed in `docker-compose.yml`. Data is stored in a volume named `postgres-data`.

While the definition itself works unmodified, it uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/python` image which includes `git`, `eslint`, `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies and Python tools for development. You can pick a different version of this image by updating the `VARIANT` arg in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` to pick either Python version 3, 3.8, 3.7, or 3.6.

```yaml
build:
  context: ..
  dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile
  args:
    VARIANT: 3.7
```

You also can connect to PostgreSQL from an external tool when using VS Code by updating `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` as follows:

```json
"forwardPorts": [ "5432" ]
```

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentaiton](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```

### Installing Node.js

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with a Python back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

```json
args:
  VARIANT: 3.7
  INSTALL_NODE: "true",
  NODE_VERSION: "10"
```

### Installing or updating Python utilities

This container installs all Python development utilities using [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to avoid impacting the global Python environment. You can use this same utility add additional utilities in an isolated environment. For example:

```bash
pipx install prospector
```

See the [pipx documentation](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/docs/) for additional information.

### Debug Configuration

Note that only the integrated terminal is supported by the Remote - Containers extension. You may need to modify `launch.json` configurations to include the following value if an external console is used.

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

### Using the forwardPorts property

By default, frameworks like Flask only listens to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property (available in v0.98.0+) to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [5000]
```

The `ports` property in `docker-compose.yml` [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port, this will not work in a Codespace and applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. This conflicts with the defaults of some Python frameworks, but fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.

If you've already opened your folder in a container, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) so the settings take effect.

### [Optional] Building your requirements into the container image

If your requirements rarely change, you can include the contents of `requirements.txt` in the container by adding the following to your `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/pip-tmp/
RUN pip3 --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir install -r /tmp/pip-tmp/requirements.txt \
    && rm -rf /tmp/pip-tmp
```

Since `requirements.txt` is likely in the folder you opened rather than the `.devcontainer` folder, be sure to include `context: ..` under `build` in `docker-compose.yml`. This allows the Dockerfile to access everything in the opened folder instead of just the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder.

### [Optional] Allowing the non-root vscode user to pip install globally without sudo

You can opt into using the `vscode` non-root user in the container by adding `"remoteUser": "vscode"` to `devcontainer.json`. However, by default, this you will need to use `sudo` to perform global pip installs.

```bash
sudo pip install <your-package-here>
```

Or stick with user installs:

```bash
pip install --user <your-package-here>
```

If you prefer, you can add the following to your `Dockerfile` to cause global installs to go into a different folder that the `vscode` user can write to.

```Dockerfile
ENV PIP_TARGET=/usr/local/pip-global
ENV PYTHONPATH=${PIP_TARGET}:${PYTHONPATH} \
    PATH=${PIP_TARGET}/bin:${PATH}
RUN mkdir -p ${PIP_TARGET} \
    && chown vscode:root ${PIP_TARGET} \
    && echo "if [ \"\$(stat -c '%U' ${PIP_TARGET})\" != \"vscode\" ]; then sudo chown -R vscode:root ${PIP_TARGET}; fi" | tee -a /etc/bash.bashrc >> /etc/zsh/zshrc
```

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Python 3 & PostgreSQL definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/python-3-postgres/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the *only* the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs. Ignore other files and folders.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/python-3-postgres` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>`</kbd> to open a terminal and run the following commands to initialize the database and create a super user:
    ```bash
    cd test-project
    pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
6. Next, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project.
7. Once the project is running, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select **Remote-Containers: Forward Port...**
8. Select port 5000 and click the "Open Browser" button in the notification that appears.
9. You should see a page with a message indicating the install was successful. You can also go to `http://localhost:<port>/admin` and sign in.
10. From here, you can add breakpoints or edit the contents of the `test-project` folder to do further testing.
