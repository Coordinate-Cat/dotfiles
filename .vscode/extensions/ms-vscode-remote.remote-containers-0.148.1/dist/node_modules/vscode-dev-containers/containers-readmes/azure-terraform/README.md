## Using this definition with an existing folder

While technically optional, this definition includes the Azure Terraform extension which requires an Azure account to use. You can create a [free trial account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and find out more about using [Teraform with Azure here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/terraform/terraform-overview).  

You can also choose the specific version of Terraform installed by updating the following line in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```Dockerfile
"arg": {
   "TERRAFORM_VERSION": "0.12.16"
   "TFLINT_VERSION": "0.8.2",
   "INSTALL_AZURE_CLI": "true",
   "INSTALL_DOCKER": "true",
   "INSTALL_NODE": "true"
}
`
If you plan to use the Azure Cloud Shell for all of your Terraform operations, you can set `"INSTALL_DOCKER": "false"`. Conversely, if you do not plan to use Cloud Shell, you can set `"INSTALL_DOCKER": "false"`. By default, both are installed so you can decide later.

Beyond `git`, this `Dockerfile` includes `zsh`, [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/), a non-root `vscode` user with `sudo` access, and a set of common dependencies for development.

### Adding the definition to your project

   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Azure Terraform definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/azure-terraform/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.
