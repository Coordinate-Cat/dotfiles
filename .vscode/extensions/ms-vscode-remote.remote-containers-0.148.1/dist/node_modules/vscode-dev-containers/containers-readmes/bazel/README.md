## Using this definition with an existing folder

While this definition works unmodified, you can set the Bazel version by updating the `BAZEL_VERSION` argument in `devcontainer.json`.

```json
"args": {
   "BAZEL_VERSION": "3.4.1"
}
```

Optionally, you can validate the SHA256 checksum for `bazel-installer.sh` by adding it to the `BAZEL_DOWNLOAD_SHA` argument:

```json
"args": {
   "BAZEL_VERSION": "3.4.1",
   "BAZEL_DOWNLOAD_SHA": "9808adad931ac652e8ff5022a74507c532250c2091d21d6aebc7064573669cc5"
}
```
