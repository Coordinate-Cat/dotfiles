## Using this definition with an existing folder

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of Ruby the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "2.7" }
```

This container also includes Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```json
"args": {
    "VARIANT": "2",
    "NODE_VERSION": "10",
}
```
