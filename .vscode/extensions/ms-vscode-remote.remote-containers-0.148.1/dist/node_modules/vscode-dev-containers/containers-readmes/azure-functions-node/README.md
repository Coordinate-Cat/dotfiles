## Using this definition with an existing folder

This definition requires an Azure subscription to use. You can create a [free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/serverless/) and learn more about using [Azure Functions with VS Code here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code).

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of Node.js the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` to a supported major Node.js release version.

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "10" }
```

### Adding the definition to your folder

Once you have an Azure account, follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
