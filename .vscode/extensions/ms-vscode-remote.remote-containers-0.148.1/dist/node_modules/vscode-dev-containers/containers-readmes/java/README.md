## Using this definition with an existing folder

> **Note:** A version of this [definition for **JDK 8**](../java-8) is also available!

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of Java the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "15" }
```

You can also directly reference pre-built versions of `.devcontainer/base.Dockerfile` by using the `image` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` or updating the `FROM` statement in your own  `Dockerfile` to one of the following. An example `Dockerfile` is included in this repository.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/java` (latest)
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/java:11`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/java:15`

Version specific tags tied to [releases in this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/releases) are also available.

- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/java:0-11`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:0.135-11`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/ruby:0.135.0-11`

Alternatively, you can use the contents of `base.Dockerfile` to fully customize your container's contents or to build it for a container host architecture not supported by the image.

### Debug Configuration

Note that only the integrated terminal is supported by the Remote - Containers extension. You may need to modify `launch.json` configurations to include the following value if an external console is used.

```json
"console": "integratedTerminal"
```

### Installing Maven or Gradle

You can opt to install a version of Maven or Gradle by adding `"INSTALL_MAVEN: "true"` or `"INSTALL_GRADLE: "true"` to build args in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Both of these are set by default. For example:

```json
"args": {
   "VARIANT": "11",
   "INSTALL_GRADLE": "true",
   "INSTALL_MAVEN": "true"
}
```

Remove the appropriate arg or set its value to `"false"` to skip installing the specified tool.

You can also specify the version of Gradle or Maven if needed.

```json
"args": {
   "VARIANT": "11",
   "INSTALL_GRADLE": "true",
   "MAVEN_VERSION": "3.6.3",
   "INSTALL_MAVEN": "true",
   "GRADLE_VERSION": "5.4.1"
}
```

### Installing Node.js

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with a Java back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can enable installation and change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```json
"args": {
   "VARIANT": "11",
    "INSTALL_NODE": "true",
    "NODE_VERSION": "10",
}
```

   2. Copy the contents of `containers/java/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:
