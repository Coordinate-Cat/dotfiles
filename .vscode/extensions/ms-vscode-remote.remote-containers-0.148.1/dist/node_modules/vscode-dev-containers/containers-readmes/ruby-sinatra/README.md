## Using this definition with an existing folder

While this definition should work unmodified, you can select the version of Ruby the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `devcontainer.json` (and rebuilding if you've already created the container).

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "2.7" }
```

### Installing Node.js

Given JavaScript front-end web client code written for use in conjunction with a Ruby back-end often requires the use of Node.js-based utilities to build, this container also includes `nvm` so that you can easily install Node.js. You can change the version of Node.js installed or disable its installation by updating the `args` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

```json
"args": {
    "VARIANT": "2",
    "INSTALL_NODE": "true",
    "NODE_VERSION": "10",
}
```

### Adding the definition to your folder

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To start then:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Ruby 2 definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/ruby-sinatra/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.

## Testing the definition

This definition includes some test code that will help you verify it is working as expected on your system. Follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Start VS Code, press <kbd>F1</kbd>, and select **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...**
4. Select the `containers/ruby-sinatra` folder.
5. After the folder has opened in the container, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start the project.
6. You should see "Try http://localhost:4567/ in the browser!" in the Debug Console. Press <kbd>F1</kbd>. Select **Forward a Port** then choose **Forward 4567**, and by browsing http://localhost:4567/ you should see "Hello from Sinatra!".
