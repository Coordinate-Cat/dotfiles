## v0.3.1071 (February 27th, 2019)

### Bug fixes
1. _Live Share Settings_ - Last release, we introduced a bunch of new features to Live Share. This release, we worked on giving users more fine-grain control on availability of certain features. Now you can:
   - [Control the sharing of external files](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/54) by setting the `liveshare.shareExternalFiles` or `Share External Files` to `true`
   - [Set whether to allow read-only guests](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/3) into a session with the `liveshare.anonymousGuestApproval` or "Anonymous Guest Approval` setting.
   - [Set whether auto-shared servers](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/113) are automatically opened in browser by setting the `liveshare.openSharedServers` or `Open Shared Servers` to `true.

### Feature Enhancements
1. Feedback viewlet - We made it easier to find and submit feedback to us! In the Live Share activity bar tab, there is how "Help" viewlet. From here, you can report a problem to us via Twitter or GitHub, as well as open a getting started guide for Live Share with the "More info"

   ![Feedback viewlet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49979728-224a1580-ff05-11e8-8110-7922398bab01.png)

## v0.3.1011

This is a massive release that addresses some of our top feature requests. We really appreciate all of the usage/feedback, so please keep letting us know how to improve!

<a id="features-all"></a>
### Feature Enhancements (VS Code / Visual Studio)

1. [*Shared source control state + diffs*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/36) 🚀- During a collaboration session, guests will now be able to see the list of files with uncommitted changes, and view their diffs against `HEAD`. This is a critical piece of context for orienting yourself with a project, and in Visual Studio Code, also provides guests with shared access to another core activity tab: `Source Control`. Visual Studio support for shared source control state is provided by the new ([Pull Requests for Visual Studio extension](https://aka.ms/pr4vs)), which currently requires Visual Studio 2019 Preview.

   ![Shared source control diffs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49205369-ac21ac80-f363-11e8-8d08-a2fb2e27271a.gif)

2. [*PR-like code comments*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/69) 🔥- While in a collaboration session, participants can now add comments directly to lines of code, as if the session were a lightweight, real-time pull request. This experience enables Live Share to be used for "pre-PRs"/informal code reviews, where guests can leave comments/todos for the host to address later or offline. Additionally, for long-running sessions (many of our users do multi-hour Live Shares!), you can use comments as bookmarks or reminders of things to address later, to help focus the collaboration, and enable checkpoints after working independently for periods of time.

   ![Code comments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49205709-af696800-f364-11e8-9e40-9a9affbfffbe.gif)

3. [*Anonymous/read-only guests*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/3) - Guests can join a session as read-only without signing in. When a user tries to join a session, they select the option to "Continue as read-only guest", and enter their name to be identifiable in the session. This is a lightweight way for guests to join into a collaboration session without needing to sign in with a GitHub or Microsoft account, while still being able to see and navigate the code.

![Read-only Guest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49208001-6bc62c80-f36b-11e8-868a-0b7e3efa5ed3.gif)

4. [*Sharing "external files"*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/54) - When in a collaboration session, if the host opens an external file outside of the shared project, that file is automatically shared with the guests. This is useful if the host wants to show a relevant file to guests that might not be included in the folder/project that is shared (e.g. log or test result files).

5. [*Read-only elevation*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/903) - In a read-only session, the host has the ability to grant guests read/write access to the code. Guests will then be able to make edits to files. This is useful in cases where a host has multiple guests in a session and wants to keep most of these users as read-only, but grant individual users read/write access (e.g. an interactive lecture where the teacher has students as read-only, but giving a specific  student access to the code to demonstrate or write something in the code).

![elevate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49320941-6d056f80-f4b9-11e8-8e06-128f4ca7b9f3.gif)

6. [*Silencing verbose notifications*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/1069) - We added the ability to control the showing of verbose notifications in a session such as notifying when a guest joins or leaves. By setting `liveshare.showVerboseNotifications` _(VS Code)_ or `Show Verbose Notifications` to `true` will prevent any of such notifications from showing.

### Feature Enhancements

1. [*Contacts*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/442) - Live Share now supports the ability to more quickly start a live share session with the contacts you're likely to collaborate with, all from within VS Code. Setting `liveshare.features` to `Experimental`, there is now a "Contacts" viewlet in the Live Share tab that provides a list of contacts to start a session with. There are two different suggestion providers currently available:
   - A Git-based provider, that shows the people you're most likely to collaborate with on the currently open project.
   - A list of contacts that you’ve recently collaborated with (by either joining or sharing with them).

   ![Contacts Viewlet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49333444-ce8a1480-f573-11e8-8d01-7dbfe392e922.png)
   With these suggested and recent contacts, you have the ability to send an invite via email.

2. *Presence Providers* - To augment the contacts list, we’re working on presence information that allow you to see if a user is online and directly invite them into a session. With the [Team Chat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karigari.chat), we support showing presence of contacts for Slack and Discord.

3. [*Automatically sharing web servers*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/113) - Live Share now supports the ability to detect and automatically share servers that your app is using. This does so by looking at output in the Terminal, and detecting if localhost URLs are utilized. To enable the automatic sharing of servers, set `liveshare.autoShareServers` to `true`.

![Auto Share Server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49344651-2fc2ee00-f62f-11e8-9cf1-497fbca7f522.gif)

4. [*Sharing a server by URL*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/893) 🔥 -  As a host, if you want to share a port that is only available via `https`, or a specific path from a port (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/foo/bar`), you can now paste in the URL for the port you want to share, and that will be shared properly to your guest so they can quickly copy the link or directly open the full URL in their browser.

![Share server by URL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49311461-10dd2400-f496-11e8-93e6-f655380c2d98.gif)

5. [*Git co-author attribution*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/558) - Hosts can now add Live Share guests as co-authors in their commit messages. By enabling the `liveshare.populateGitCoAuthors`, the Source Control tab in VS Code will automatically generate the "Co-authored by" trailer in the commit message, so hosts can attribute the collaborators they worked with during a pair programming session.

6. [*Text chat*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/69) - The [Team Chat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=karigari.chat) now provides a lightweight way to chat with participants in a Live Share session without needing to have a Slack or Discord backend. After starting a live share session, you can click the `Chat` button in the status bar to start a conversation with participants in the session. You can also access this chat via the Live Share viewlet, and selecting "Chat channel". Additionally, you can use the extension to connect to your existing Slack or Discord accounts to share a Live Share session with your contacts.

![Team Chat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49338148-e644b580-f5d2-11e8-81da-34c1362177f2.gif)

7. *Audio in viewlet* - If the user has the [Live Share Audio Extension](http://aka.ms/vsls-audio) installed, an additional node will be added to the Live Share viewlet for "Audio Call". As a participant, users will have the ability to start an audio call (if one has not already been started). Additionally, users will be able to see participants that are currently in an audio call, and have controls for muting themselves.

![audio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49326456-348c8280-f507-11e8-8fed-de516040e569.png)

8. *Merge conflicts* - If a merge conflict is detected when you are trying to push your code, we now show a code lens to start a Live Share session. This will enable you to collaborate with your teammates to solve merge conflicts and more quickly push your code to the repo.

![Merge Conflict Code Lens for Live Share](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4979659/49332979-a4ccef80-f56b-11e8-8540-f2f1f6c0744b.png)

8. *Deep-link install* - When a user opens a join link for a session without already having Live Share, clicking the install link for VS Code on the landing page will launch VS Code, install Live Share, and join the user in the session they were initially linked. This makes it easier for first-time Live Share guests who have not set up their tools to join into their first Live Share session.

### Community Integrations

The Visual Studio Live Share team is working hard to make collaborative development great out-of-the-box (e.g. sharing edits, debugging, terminals, workspace tasks, [voice calls](https://aka.ms/vsls-audio), etc.) However, we're just one member in the large and prolific Visual Studio Code community, and therefore, to provide a truly amazing collaboration experience for developers, we're excited to be partnering with key products/extensions in order to expand the context/capabilities available in a Live Share session.

1. *GitLens* [#36](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/36)/[#39](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/39) - Guests now have read-only access to [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) functionalities when they join a session (provided both the host and guest has GitLens installed). Guests can visualize code authorship with Git blame annotations, navigate through line/file/repo history, and view diffs between arbitrary baselines (e.g commits, branches, or tags).

2. *Live Server* - If the host has a [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) already running when they start a Live Share session, it will detect the Live Server and prompt the host if they want to share the server. By allowing that, guests will have access to the Live Server.

This is a bug fix release that addresses some user-reported issues. We really appreciate all of the usage/feedback, so please keep letting us know how to improve!

### Bug Fixes (VS Code)

1. [*Show GitHub username instead of e-mail*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/369) - When collaborating with users that authenticated via GitHub, you'll now see their username instead of e-mail (in join toasts, when hovering over their name in the explorer view).

2. [*Simplifying the guest joined notification*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/1104) - We removed the `Reject and block` button from the notification the host sees when a guest joins their session. In practice, some users were accidentally clicking this, thinking it would dismiss the toast. Now that we've added the ability to remove a guest from the Live Share activity bar view, we no longer needed the button in the join toast.

3. [*Multi-root workspace improvements*](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/1131) - If you share a workspace that includes a non-local root (e.g. opened using the [Remote Workspace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkloubert.vscode-remote-workspace)), or a root that's no longer available (e.g. a directory that was deleted), the workspace will now share correctly, but the unsupported roots will show up as unavailable to the guest. Previously, the share operation would fail entirely in these cases, and we wanted to unblock sharing the valid roots.

4. *Undo fixes* - There were cases where an undo could leave an extra character in your file. This has now been resolved, which makes co-editing more reliable.
