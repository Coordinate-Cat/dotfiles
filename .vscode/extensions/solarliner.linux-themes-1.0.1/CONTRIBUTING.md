# Contributing to this project

Thank you for expressing your interest for this project. I am glad you want to help me.

There are few things you can do to participate:

### Submit your color themes

By any way you want, i.e. through a fork, an issue with the theme file attached...; I am interested in having as many of the popular GTK themes as possible. You'll be credited (bonus points with forking as it will appear in the logs and when [blaming](https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/) files) wherever necessary.

### Tell me about issues in the themes

I can't simply do every test case ever, so please, do tell me through the Issues system what's going on. It allows me not only to know, but to also keep track of the issues.  
This seems like a furstrating part of maintaining the extension, but for me this is extremely valuable information.

### Join me as a maintainer of the extension

I can't do everything alone, and if you're really interested in working on this extensions, more so than just a one-off contribution, then you can request to be added for write access on the repository.
