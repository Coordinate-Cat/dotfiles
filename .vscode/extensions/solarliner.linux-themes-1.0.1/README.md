## An integrated color theme for the most popular Linux GTK themes

These VS Code themes integrate seamlessly with your GTK themes to provide a more integrated experience.

For the Arc theme, the syntax coloring is the default VS Code one. For Adapta, it is taken from [Mattia Astorino's great Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) (an alternative to this Adapta theme!)

Syntax coloring used:

- **Arc**: Base16 Tommorow Dark
- **Adapta**: [Mattia Astorino's great Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) (an alternative to this Adapta theme!)
- **United Ubuntu** & **Ambiance**: Base16 IR Black

I created those themes myself to suit my needs - I hope you wil like it too!
